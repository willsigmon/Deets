## Social Media Strategy

### Core Principles

1. **Privacy-First Messaging**: Every post reinforces our commitment to user privacy
2. **Educational Content**: Teach users about data privacy, not just our app
3. **Human Voice**: Sound like a real person, not a corporate account
4. **Value Before Promotion**: Share useful content, not just "download our app"
5. **Community Engagement**: Respond to every mention, question, and comment

### Target Platforms

**Primary** (Launch Focus):
- Twitter/X (tech community, privacy advocates)
- Product Hunt (launch platform)
- Hacker News (tech-savvy audience)

**Secondary** (Post-Launch):
- LinkedIn (business professionals)
- Mastodon (privacy-conscious community)
- Reddit (r/privacy, r/iOS, r/productivity)

**Tertiary** (Future):
- Instagram (visual focus, less relevant for B2B)
- Facebook (older demographic, less active)
- Threads (if it gains traction)

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Twitter/X (@DeetsApp)

**Profile Setup**:
```
Name: Deets
Handle: @DeetsApp
Bio: Privacy-first business card scanner for iOS. Scan, save, export—all on your device. No cloud. No tracking. No accounts. Meet once. Remember always.
Website: https://deets.app
Location: [City, State] (optional)
Profile Picture: App icon (interlocking dots)
Header Image: Teal gradient with tagline
```

**Posting Strategy**:
- **Frequency**: 3-5 tweets per week
- **Best Times**: Weekdays 9-11 AM, 1-3 PM ET (when professionals check Twitter)
- **Tone**: Conversational, slightly technical, privacy-focused
- **Hashtags**: 1-2 per tweet max (avoid spam)

**Content Mix** (Weekly):
- 2 educational posts (privacy tips, not app-specific)

- 1 community engagement (retweet user feedback, polls)
- 1 industry commentary (react to privacy news)

**Sample Tweets**:

**Launch Announcement** (280 chars):
```
Deets is live on the App Store 🎉

The privacy-first business card scanner that keeps everything on your device. No cloud. No tracking. No BS.

Meet once. Remember always.

[App Store Link]
```

**Educational** (Privacy Tips):
```
Before downloading a business card scanner, ask:

• Does it require an account?
• Where is my data stored?
• Can I export my contacts?
• Does it work offline?

If the app can't answer these clearly, your privacy is probably the product.
```

**Feature Highlight**:
```
Deets scans business cards entirely on your iPhone using Apple's VisionKit.

No servers. No cloud processing. No data leaves your device unless you export it.

This is how networking apps should work.
```

**Industry Commentary**:
```
Saw another "free" business card app get acquired by a data broker.

Reminder: If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.

Deets costs $2.99 once. No subscription. No data mining. Own it forever.
```

**User Engagement**:
```
Thanks @username! We built Deets because we were tired of apps that treat your contacts like their inventory.

Privacy should be the default, not a premium feature.
```

**Launch Announcement**:
```
We're excited to launch Deets, a privacy-first business card scanner for iOS.

After attending countless conferences and networking events, we were frustrated by apps that required accounts, uploaded contacts to cloud servers, and monetized user data.

So we built Deets differently:
✅ On-device OCR (Apple's VisionKit)
✅ No account or login required
✅ Offline-capable (works at any event)
✅ Export to Contacts, VCF, or CSV
✅ $2.99 one-time purchase (no subscription)

Privacy and convenience shouldn't be mutually exclusive.

```

**Thought Leadership**:
```
Free business card scanner apps have a hidden cost: your data.

Most "free" scanners:
• Require accounts (tracking)
• Upload contacts to cloud servers (risk)
• Monetize data through ads or "premium" upsells

At Deets, we believe privacy should be the default. That's why we charge $2.99 upfront and process everything on your device.

Your contacts belong to you, not us.

```
Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I built Deets because I was tired of business card scanners that required accounts and sent my contacts to the cloud.

After researching Apple's VisionKit framework, I realized it's possible to scan cards entirely on-device—no servers needed. So I spent 6 months building Deets to prove privacy and convenience can coexist.

Key features:
• On-device OCR using VisionKit
• Offline-capable (no internet required)
• Export to Apple Contacts, VCF, CSV
• No account, no cloud, no tracking
• $2.99 one-time (no subscription)

I'm here all day to answer questions, take feedback, or chat about privacy, iOS development, or why most "free" apps are surveillance tools.

Thanks for checking out Deets!

Hey HN, I built Deets after getting frustrated with business card scanners that required accounts and sent data to cloud servers.

Deets uses Apple's VisionKit framework to process cards entirely on your iPhone. No backend, no analytics, no tracking. Export to Apple Contacts, VCF, or CSV. Works offline.

Tech stack:
- Swift 5.9 + SwiftUI
- VisionKit for on-device OCR
- SwiftData for local storage
- Optional iCloud sync (encrypted by Apple)

Why not free? Because I don't want to monetize your data. $2.99 one-time, no subscription.

I'm here to answer questions about VisionKit, privacy-first app design, or anything else. Feedback welcome!

### Reddit

**Target Subreddits**:
- r/privacy (privacy-focused users)
- r/iOS (iPhone users)
- r/productivity (professionals)
- r/SideProject (indie makers)
- r/iOSProgramming (developers)

**Posting Guidelines**:
- **Read rules first**: Each subreddit has different self-promotion policies
- **Provide value**: Share privacy insights, not just "download my app"
- **Engage deeply**: Reddit rewards detailed comments, not drive-by posts

**Sample Post** (r/privacy):
```
Title: I built a business card scanner that processes everything on-device (no cloud)

Body:
After attending tech conferences, I was uncomfortable with how many card scanner apps require accounts and upload contacts to cloud servers.

So I built Deets using Apple's VisionKit framework, which does OCR entirely on your iPhone. No backend servers, no analytics, no data collection.

Features:
• Scan business cards with camera
• Extract contact info (name, email, phone, etc.)
• Export to Apple Contacts, VCF, or CSV
• Optional iCloud sync (user-controlled, encrypted by Apple)
• Offline-capable

I charge $2.99 upfront instead of making it "free" and monetizing data.

You can verify privacy claims with network monitoring tools—Deets makes zero external requests during scanning.

GitHub: [link if open-sourcing]
App Store: [link]

Happy to answer questions about the tech, privacy design, or anything else.

Thanks [name]! We're glad Deets is working for you. Privacy and convenience can coexist 🙂

If you have feature requests, email support@deets.app—we read everything.
```

### Negative Feedback (Feature Request)
```
Thanks for the feedback, [name]. [Feature] is on our roadmap for v1.2. We're a small team so we're prioritizing based on user requests.

Mind emailing support@deets.app with more details? Helps us prioritize.
```

### Negative Feedback (Bug Report)
```
Sorry to hear that, [name]. This sounds like a bug. Can you email support@deets.app with:
• iOS version
• iPhone model
• Screenshot (if applicable)

We'll fix it ASAP. Thanks for reporting!
```

### Competitor Mention
```
We respect [Competitor]—they're solving the same problem. The difference: Deets processes everything on-device (no cloud servers).

If privacy is your priority, give Deets a try. If [Competitor] works for you, awesome!
```

### Privacy Question
```
Great question. Deets uses Apple's VisionKit framework, which processes images entirely on your device. We have no backend servers.

You can verify this with network monitoring tools—Deets makes zero external requests during scanning.

More details: https://deets.app/privacy
```

### Pricing Question
```
We charge $2.99 because we don't want to monetize your data. No subscription, no ads, no upsells.

Free apps make money somehow—usually by selling your data. We'd rather be honest about the transaction.
