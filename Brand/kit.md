## Brand Overview

### Mission Statement

Deets exists to eliminate the friction between meeting someone and staying connected. We believe networking should be effortless, private, and human.

### Brand Positioning

**Tagline**: "Meet once. Remember always."

**Positioning Statement**:
For professionals who value genuine connections, Deets is the business card scanner that respects your privacy while keeping relationships alive. Unlike CRM tools that feel corporate or cloud scanners that compromise your data, Deets keeps everything on your device and gets out of your way.

### Brand Personality

**Confident**: We know privacy matters. We don't apologize for doing things differently.
**Human**: We talk like real people, not a corporate press release.
**Clear**: No jargon, no confusion. Scan, save, done.
**Trustworthy**: Privacy-first isn't a feature. It's who we are.
**Efficient**: We respect your time. Every screen has a purpose.

### Brand Values

1. **Privacy Above All**: Your contacts belong to you. Period.
2. **Simplicity in Execution**: Complex tech, simple experience.
3. **Human Connection**: Technology should strengthen relationships, not replace them.
4. **Transparency**: No hidden agendas. No data harvesting. No BS.
5. **Quality Over Speed**: Ship when it's right, not when it's rushed.

- **Connection**: Two entities (people) meeting
- **Privacy**: Distinct, separate entities maintaining boundaries
- **Continuity**: The overlap creates something new (a relationship)

### Logo Anatomy

## Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice

Our voice is **confident, human, clear, and privacy-focused**. We sound like a knowledgeable friend who respects your time.

#### Voice Principles

1. **Confident, Not Arrogant**
   - ✅ "Everything stays on your device."
   - ❌ "We're the only app that cares about your privacy."

2. **Human, Not Corporate**
   - ✅ "Scan a card. Save it. Done."
   - ❌ "Leverage our enterprise-grade contact acquisition solution."

3. **Clear, Not Clever**
   - ✅ "Tap to scan your first business card."
   - ❌ "Let's get this party started! 🎉"

4. **Helpful, Not Preachy**
   - ✅ "Turn on iCloud sync to access contacts on all your devices."
   - ❌ "You really should enable sync. Most people do."

### Tone Variations by Context

#### Onboarding (Welcoming)
- **Goal**: Make new users feel capable
- **Tone**: Warm, encouraging, brief
- **Example**: "Welcome to Deets. Scan your first card to get started."

#### Empty States (Encouraging)
- **Goal**: Prompt action without feeling pushy
- **Tone**: Friendly, light, actionable
- **Example**: "No cards yet. Tap the scan button to add your first contact."

#### Errors (Apologetic but Clear)
- **Goal**: Explain what went wrong and how to fix it
- **Tone**: Honest, helpful, not dramatic
- **Example**: "Couldn't save contact. Check your storage and try again."

#### Settings (Informative)
- **Goal**: Help users make informed choices
- **Tone**: Transparent, educational, neutral
- **Example**: "iCloud Sync keeps contacts in sync across your devices. All data is encrypted by Apple."

#### Success States (Affirming)
- **Goal**: Confirm action without over-celebrating
- **Tone**: Simple, positive, brief
- **Example**: "Contact saved."

### Writing Guidelines

**Sentence Structure**:
- Start with verbs (imperative mood): "Scan a card", "Export to Contacts"
- Keep sentences under 20 words
- One idea per sentence
- Use active voice ("Deets scans cards" not "Cards are scanned by Deets")

**Word Choice**:
- Use "you" and "your" (personal)
- Avoid jargon ("OCR" → "scan", "export" is okay)
- Be specific ("3 contacts" not "some contacts")
- No filler words ("just", "simply", "very")

**Punctuation**:
- Use periods for complete sentences
- Skip periods for buttons and short labels
- Use contractions (we're, you're, it's) to sound human
- Avoid exclamation marks unless genuinely exciting

### Sample Copy by Use Case

#### Permissions Requests

**Camera**:
> Deets needs camera access to scan business cards. All scanning happens on your device.

**Contacts**:
> Export contacts to your iPhone's Contacts app. Deets only writes contacts you choose to export.

## Appendix: Design Principles

### Simplicity
Every screen should have one primary action. If you can't identify it in 3 seconds, the design is too complex.

### Privacy by Design
Never ask for permissions until the moment they're needed. Always explain why before requesting.

### Accessibility First
Every UI element must work with VoiceOver. Every color must pass contrast checks. Dynamic Type is non-negotiable.

### Respect Time
Users are busy. Get them in, get them done, get them out. No unnecessary steps.

### Human Touch
Design like you're talking to a friend. Clear labels, helpful hints, forgiving errors.
