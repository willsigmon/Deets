2. **Product Hunt** - Tech-savvy early adopters are your ideal users. Invest time here.

3. **Content Marketing** - SEO takes time but compounds. Start immediately.

4. **Ignoring Feedback** - Users will tell you what needs fixing. Listen.

5. **Burning Out** - Marketing is a marathon. Pace yourself.

### Success Factors:

1. **Consistency** - Show up every day. Small daily actions compound.

2. **Authenticity** - Be real. People connect with humans, not brands.

3. **User Focus** - Make users successful and they'll do your marketing for you.

4. **Data-Driven** - Track everything. Double down on what works.
