## New iOS App "Deets" Offers Privacy-First Business Card Scanning for Professionals

*Free app keeps contact data local, rejecting industry trend of cloud storage and tracking*

**[CITY, STATE] – [DATE]** – Today marks the launch of Deets, a new iOS application that reimagines business card scanning with privacy as its foundation. Unlike competitors that upload contact data to cloud servers, Deets stores everything locally on the user's device, ensuring complete privacy and data ownership.

### The Problem

Professionals attend networking events and conferences, collecting dozens of business cards that often end up lost or forgotten. While digital scanning solutions exist, most require uploading personal contact information to corporate servers, raising privacy and security concerns.

"After every conference, I'd have a stack of business cards on my desk for weeks," said [Founder Name], creator of Deets. "The few scanning apps I tried either cost money or wanted to upload my contacts to the cloud. I wanted something simple, private, and free."

### The Solution

Deets leverages Apple's VisionKit framework to instantly extract contact information from business cards using the iPhone camera. Users can review and edit the scanned data before saving it to their iOS Contacts app. The entire process happens on-device, with no internet connection required.

**Key features include:**

- **Instant OCR scanning** powered by Apple's VisionKit technology
- **100% local storage** with no cloud sync or server uploads
- **Native iOS integration** with seamless Contacts app export
- **Smart editing** to review and correct scanned information
- **Powerful search and filtering** to find contacts quickly
- **Completely free** with no subscription or in-app purchases

### Privacy-First Architecture

Deets is built on the principle that privacy isn't a feature—it's a foundation. The app:

- Stores all data locally using SwiftData
- Requires no account creation or email address
- Collects zero analytics or usage data
- Cannot access or transmit contact information
- Works completely offline

"Your contacts are nobody's business but yours," [Founder Name] explained. "We built Deets to prove you don't need to sacrifice privacy for convenience."

### Availability

Deets is available now as a free download on the App Store for devices running iOS 16.0 or later. The app works on iPhone and iPad with camera access required for scanning.

### About Deets

Deets is an independent iOS application created by [Founder Name], [title/background]. The app was built to solve a real problem faced by professionals who network frequently: managing business card contacts without compromising privacy.

### Technical Details

Deets is built with:
- **SwiftUI** for a modern, native iOS experience
- **SwiftData** for local data persistence
- **VisionKit** for advanced text recognition
- **Contacts Framework** for iOS integration

The app exemplifies Apple's privacy-first design principles and serves as an example of building useful applications without collecting user data.
