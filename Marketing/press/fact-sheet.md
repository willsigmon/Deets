## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why is Deets free?**
A: We built Deets to solve a problem we had. Making it free and privacy-first was always the plan. If we monetize in the future, it will never be through selling user data.

**Q: How do you make money?**
A: Currently, we don't. This is a passion project. We may explore ethical monetization (like optional premium features) in the future, but only if they align with our privacy values.

**Q: Will you add cloud sync?**
A: Possibly, but only as an optional feature using end-to-end encryption with iCloud. Privacy will never be compromised.

**Q: Why iOS only?**
A: We wanted to build a truly native experience using the latest iOS frameworks. An Android version is possible in the future, but we're focused on iOS for now.

**Q: Can I trust you with my contacts?**
A: We never see your contacts. Everything stays on your device. We designed the app so we couldn't access your data even if we wanted to.

**Q: Is Deets open source?**
A: Not yet, but we're considering it. We want to be transparent about our privacy claims and allow community audits.
