## Long Bio (300-400 words)

[Your Name] is an iOS developer, privacy advocate, and creator of Deets—a business card scanning app that prioritizes user privacy over profit.

### Background

[Adapt to your actual story. Examples below:]

**Option 1 - Developer Background:**
With over [X] years of experience building iOS applications, [Name] has worked on apps ranging from [industry] to [industry], serving millions of users worldwide. [He/She/They] specialized in [SwiftUI/iOS frameworks/etc.] and has been a vocal advocate for privacy-preserving design in mobile applications.

**Option 2 - Career Switcher:**
After spending [X] years in [previous career: sales, marketing, consulting, etc.], [Name] taught [himself/herself/themselves] iOS development to build solutions for problems [he/she/they] faced daily. Deets is [his/her/their] [first/second/third] app, born from real-world frustration with existing business card management tools.

**Option 3 - Indie Developer:**
[Name] is an independent iOS developer who builds apps [he/she/they] wishes existed. Previous projects include [App Name - brief description]. [His/Her/Their] work focuses on creating simple, privacy-respecting tools that solve everyday problems without dark patterns or data exploitation.

### The Deets Origin Story

The idea for Deets emerged from a common professional frustration. After attending a major industry conference in [Year], [Name] returned home with 40+ business cards and good intentions to follow up with everyone. Two weeks later, the cards were still sitting on [his/her/their] desk, and most of the connections were lost.

"I tried a few scanning apps, but they all wanted to upload my contacts to their servers. As someone who cares about privacy, I couldn't understand why that was necessary. Your business contacts are sensitive—they're relationships, they're potential deals, they're personal connections. Why should you have to trust some random company with all that?"

After searching for a privacy-first alternative and finding none, [Name] decided to build it [himself/herself/themselves].

### Building Deets

Deets was built entirely in [timeframe: "6 months," "evenings and weekends over a year," etc.] using Apple's latest frameworks: SwiftUI for the interface, SwiftData for local persistence, and VisionKit for text recognition. Every architectural decision prioritized user privacy.

"I designed Deets so that even if I wanted to access user data, I couldn't. There's no backend, no server, no API. It's just the app and the user's device. That's how all apps should work unless there's a compelling reason otherwise."

The app launched on [Date] and quickly gained traction in the iOS community for its privacy-first approach and clean design. Within [timeframe], it reached [milestone: downloads, rating, etc.].

### Philosophy

[Name]'s approach to app development is simple: build tools that respect users.

"We've normalized apps that track everything we do, sell our data, and make us the product. But it doesn't have to be that way. You can build great software, provide real value, and still respect user privacy. Deets is proof of that."

[He/She/They] believes in:
- **Privacy by design**, not as an afterthought
- **Simplicity** over feature bloat
- **User ownership** of their data
- **Transparency** about how apps work
- **Sustainability** without exploiting users

### Current Work

Today, [Name] continues to improve Deets based on user feedback while maintaining its privacy-first principles. [He/She/They] [is/are] also [working on other projects/writing about iOS development/speaking at conferences/building in public on Twitter].

[Name] is available for:
- Podcast interviews about privacy-first development
- Tech conference speaking engagements
- Collaborations with like-minded developers
- Consulting on privacy-preserving app architecture

### Personal

When not coding, [Name] [enjoys/likes/etc.] [hobbies: "reading sci-fi," "hiking," "photography," etc.]. [He/She/They] [lives/is based] in [City, State/Country] [with family/with pets/other personal detail if you want to include it].

## In Their Own Words

**On Privacy:**
> "Privacy isn't a premium feature that only paid users deserve. It should be the default. Every time we accept that an app 'needs' our data, we're normalizing surveillance. I built Deets to show there's another way."

**On Building Deets:**
> "I wanted to prove that you could build a genuinely useful app, make it free, and still respect users. No dark patterns, no data harvesting, no VC pressure to 'monetize the user base.' Just a tool that solves a problem."

**On Indie Development:**
> "The best part about building independently is that my only stakeholder is the user. I don't have to compromise on privacy to hit growth metrics or prepare for an acquisition. I can just build something good and put it into the world."

**On the Future:**
> "If Deets inspires even one other developer to prioritize privacy in their own app, that's a win. We need more tools that work for users, not on them."
