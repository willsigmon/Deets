**Q: Do you have user testimonials?**
A: Yes, we can provide verified testimonials from beta testers and early users. Contact us for specific use cases (sales, entrepreneurs, etc.).

**Q: Can we interview actual users?**
A: Possibly. We can connect you with users who've agreed to share their stories (with their permission).
