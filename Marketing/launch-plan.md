**First Comment (Post Immediately):**
```
Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], creator of Deets. I built this app because I was
tired of coming home from networking events with a stack of
business cards that I'd never actually use.

The problem: Business cards get lost, typing them into Contacts
is tedious, and most card scanner apps either cost money or
upload your contacts to sketchy servers.

The solution: Deets scans cards instantly using your iPhone's
camera, lets you review the info, and saves to your Contacts.
Everything stays on your device - no cloud, no tracking,
no subscriptions.

I'd love to hear what you think! AMA about the app, the
tech stack (SwiftUI + VisionKit), or building privacy-first
iOS apps.

Special thanks to the beta testers who helped make this
app better. You rock! 🚀

Hi [Name],

I thought [Publication] readers might be interested in Deets,
a new iOS app I just launched that helps professionals scan
and organize business cards.

What makes it newsworthy:

1. Privacy-first approach - 100% local storage, zero tracking
2. Free with no subscription (rare in this category)
3. Uses Apple's latest VisionKit framework
4. Built by solo indie developer

The app solves a real problem: coming home from networking
events with a stack of business cards you'll never use.
Deets lets you scan them in seconds and save to Contacts,
all while keeping your data private.

Would you be interested in covering it? I can provide:
- Press kit with screenshots and demo video
