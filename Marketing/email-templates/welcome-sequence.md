   Point your camera at any business card
   Watch the magic happen ✨

2️⃣ REVIEW & EDIT
   Check that everything looks right
   Add notes while the context is fresh
   ("Met at tech conference, interested in partnership")

3️⃣ SAVE IT
   Tap "Save to Contacts" to add to your iPhone
   Or just save in Deets for searchable storage

That's it! You're now a pro.

Quick tip for best results:

🌟 FAVORITES
Tap the star on any contact to mark them as a favorite.
Access them quickly from the Favorites filter.

Perfect for: VIP clients, key partners, people you
reference often

---

🔍 SMART SEARCH
The search bar finds contacts by name, company, email,
or even notes you added.

Try it: Search for a company name to find everyone you
know there

---

📝 CONTEXT NOTES
After scanning, tap "Add Notes" to capture where you
met, what you discussed, or follow-up tasks.

Pro tip: Do this immediately while it's fresh in your
memory!

---

✏️ EDIT ANYTIME
Tap any contact to edit their info. People change jobs,
emails, and phone numbers - keep your contacts current.

---

🔄 BULK EXPORT
Select multiple contacts and export them all at once
to your Contacts app.

## Email 3: Success Story
**Sent:** Day 7
**Subject:** How Sarah Doubled Her Follow-Up Rate with Deets

```
Quick story I thought you'd appreciate...

Sarah is a sales manager who attends 2-3 conferences
per month. Before Deets, she'd collect 50+ business
cards per event but only follow up with about 10 people.

The problem? By the time she got back to the office,
she couldn't remember who was who or what they discussed.

Her new workflow:

1. Scan cards during coffee breaks (30 seconds)
2. Add quick notes while fresh
   "Interested in Q3 partnership, follow up with case study"
3. All contacts automatically organized in Deets
4. Export to her CRM once back at the office
5. Follow up within 24 hours

The result?

She now follows up with 40+ people per event, and her
connection-to-client rate went from 10% to 40%.

That's 4x more clients from the same networking effort.

The tool is just a tool. The system is what matters.

But having the right tool makes building a system way
easier.

---

Want to build your own system?

Here's my recommended workflow:

AT THE EVENT:
• Scan cards immediately (don't wait till later)
• Add context notes right away
• Star your highest-priority connections

WITHIN 24 HOURS:
• Review all contacts while memory is fresh
• Send personalized follow-up emails
• Connect on LinkedIn if appropriate
• Add to your CRM or contact system

ONGOING:
• Set reminders to reconnect (30, 60, 90 days)
• Update contact info as relationships grow
• Build authentic relationships over time

• Use consistent tags
  prospect, customer, partner, vendor, press

Review quarterly:
