# Community Building Strategy

**Goal:** Build an engaged community of Deets users who advocate for the product and help each other
**Timeline:** 90 days to foundation, ongoing growth
**Channels:** Twitter/X, Discord, Email, Reddit, Product Hunt

---

## Community Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **User-First, Always**
   - Community exists to serve users, not to sell
   - Provide value before asking for anything
   - Listen more than we talk

2. **Authentic Engagement**
   - Real conversations, not corporate speak
   - Admit mistakes, share learnings
   - Celebrate users, not just the product

3. **Privacy-Aligned**
   - No invasive analytics
   - No required accounts (where possible)
   - Respect user preferences

4. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - 100 engaged users > 10,000 passive followers
   - Deep relationships over vanity metrics
   - Sustainable growth, not hype cycles
