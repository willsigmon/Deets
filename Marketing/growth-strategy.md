                   /  \
                  / 10 \    Evangelists (create UGC, refer actively)
                 /______\
                /        \
               /   100    \  Power Users (daily use, give feedback)
              /____________\
             /              \
            /     1,000      \  Active Users (weekly use)
           /_______________  \
          /                   \
         /      10,000         \ Casual Users (monthly use)
        /_______________________\

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Fix: Add features, improve UX, email engagement

**Organic traffic declining:**
- Problem: ASO or algorithm changes
- Fix: Update screenshots, optimize keywords, ship updates

**High CAC (if paying for ads):**
- Problem: Wrong targeting or poor creative
- Fix: Refine audience, test new ads, focus on organic

**Negative reviews increasing:**
- Problem: Bugs, UX issues, unmet expectations
- Fix: Respond to reviews, fix issues, communicate better

---

## Competitive Response

### If Competitors Launch Privacy Features:
- **Double down** on our story (we were first)
- **Expand features** they don't have
- **Build community** they can't replicate
- **Stay authentic** (don't panic)

### If Competitors Undercut on Price:
- We're already free, so not applicable
- If they add premium features we lack, evaluate if needed
- Focus on our strengths: privacy, simplicity

### If Major Player Enters Market:
- They can't compete on privacy (public companies need data)
- We can move faster (no bureaucracy)
- Community loyalty is our moat
- Consider collaboration vs. competition

## The North Star

**Growth is not the goal. Impact is.**

We're not building Deets to hit vanity metrics or chase unicorn valuations. We're building it to:

1. **Help people** stay connected
2. **Prove privacy** can be profitable (or at least sustainable)
3. **Show an alternative** to surveillance capitalism
4. **Build something** we're proud of

If we do those things well, growth will follow.

---

**Final Thought:**

The best growth strategy is to build something people love and want to tell others about. Everything else is optimization.

Focus on:
1. Making users successful
2. Delighting them with the experience
3. Listening to their feedback
4. Building in public
5. Staying true to our values

Do that, and the growth will take care of itself.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Execute launch plan (see launch-plan.md)
2. Implement ASO optimizations
3. Start content marketing calendar
4. Build community foundations
5. Track metrics religiously
6. Iterate based on data

Good luck! 🚀
