🧵 5 tips for effective conference networking:

1/ Research attendees beforehand
Create a target list of 10 people you want to meet.
Know their background, company, and why you want to
connect.

2/ Bring plenty of business cards
And have a system to organize theirs. Deets helps
me scan and save cards immediately so I never lose
them.

3/ Ask thoughtful questions
"What are you working on?" beats "What do you do?"
every time. Show genuine interest.

4/ Take notes
After each conversation, jot down context. Deets
lets me add notes to each contact so I remember
key details later.

5/ Follow up within 24 hours
Reference your conversation. Be specific. Add value
before asking for anything.

```

**Example:**
```
The average professional meets 50+ new contacts at a
conference.

They follow up with fewer than 10.

I used to be one of those people. Stack of business
cards on my desk for weeks, good intentions but no
system.

Then I realized: The problem isn't networking, it's
what happens after.

Now my workflow:
1. Scan cards immediately (I built Deets to solve this)
2. Add context notes while fresh
3. Follow up within 24 hours with specific value

Result: My connection-to-client rate went from 10% to 40%.

The tool doesn't matter. The system does. But having
the right tool makes the system easier.

🛠️ Building in public

This week: Working on the iPad version of Deets.

Challenge: Making the scanning interface feel natural
on a larger screen. Do people want to scan with their
iPad, or is this more about reviewing and managing
cards?

Decided to optimize for review/management with an
optional scan mode. Seems like most people will scan
with their iPhone and manage on iPad.

What do you think? Would you scan business cards with
an iPad?

#### Email 3: Success Stories (Day 7)
**Subject:** How Sarah Doubled Her Follow-Up Rate with Deets

**Body:**
```
Quick story...

Sarah is a sales manager who attends 2-3 conferences
per month. She used to collect 50+ business cards per
event but only followed up with about 10 people.

Her problem: By the time she got back to the office,
she couldn't remember who was who or what they
discussed.

Her new workflow with Deets:
1. Scans cards during breaks (takes 30 seconds)
2. Adds quick notes while fresh ("Interested in Q3
   partnership, follow up with case study")
3. All contacts synced to her CRM via Contacts app
4. Follows up within 24 hours

Result: She now follows up with 40+ people per event,
and her connection-to-client rate went from 10% to
40%.

The tool is just a tool. The system is what matters.
But having the right tool makes building a system
way easier.

What's your follow-up system? Reply and tell me!

'too many.'"

"You go to a networking event, collect a dozen cards,
and by the time you get home, you've forgotten half
the people. The cards sit on your desk for weeks.
Eventually, you throw them away. Connection lost."

[0:30-1:00] Solution
"That's why I built Deets. It's a business card
scanner for iOS that's fast, private, and free.

Watch how it works: Point your camera at any business
card... the app automatically extracts the name, email,
phone, company, everything. Review the info, make any
edits, and save to your Contacts app. Done."

[1:00-1:45] Features
"What makes Deets different:

First, it's 100% private. Everything stays on your
device. No cloud, no servers, no tracking.

Second, it's native iOS. Fast, smooth, and integrates
perfectly with your Contacts app.

Third, it's free. No subscription, no in-app purchases,
no BS."

[1:45-2:15] Demo
"Let me show you the full workflow..."
[Screen recording of scan → edit → save]

[2:15-2:30] Privacy
"Why no cloud sync? Because your contacts are nobody's
business but yours. Deets is built on the principle
that privacy isn't a feature - it's a foundation."

[2:30-2:45] CTA
"Download Deets free on the App Store. Link in
description. And if you like it, leave a review -
it really helps.

## Final Thoughts on Content Marketing

**Consistency beats perfection.** Post regularly, even if it's not your best work.

**Engagement beats reach.** 100 engaged followers > 1,000 passive followers.

**Value beats promotion.** Help first, sell second.

**Authenticity beats polish.** People connect with humans, not brands.

**Patience beats hype.** Content marketing is a long game. Results compound over time.

Good luck! 🚀
