# Deets Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** [TO BE UPDATED BEFORE APP STORE SUBMISSION]
**Last Updated:** November 5, 2025

## Overview

Deets ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our iOS application.

**Our Core Privacy Principle:** Your data stays on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or share your personal information with anyone.

## Information We Access

### Camera Access
Deets requires access to your device's camera to enable you to:
- Capture photos of contact cards (business cards, name tags, etc.)
- Scan contact information using optical character recognition (OCR)
- Take profile photos for contacts

**What we do with camera data:**
- Process images locally on your device
- Extract contact information using on-device OCR
- Store processed contact data in your local device storage
- Never transmit camera images to external servers

**You can control camera access** through iOS Settings > Deets > Camera at any time.

### Contacts Access
Deets requires access to your Contacts to:
- Save new contacts you create from scanned images
- Allow you to link scanned information to existing contacts
- Enable contact management features

**What we do with contacts data:**
- Read and write contact information locally on your device
- Display your existing contacts within the app
- Merge scanned contact data with your Contacts database
- Never sync your contacts to external servers

**You can control contacts access** through iOS Settings > Deets > Contacts at any time.

### Photo Library Access (Future Feature - Phase 2)
In future updates, Deets may request access to your Photo Library to:
- Import existing photos of business cards or contact information
- Allow you to select images for contact profile photos
- Process previously captured images for contact extraction

**What we do with photo library data:**
- Access only photos you explicitly select
- Process selected images locally on your device
- Never automatically scan or access your entire photo library
- Never transmit photos to external servers

**You can control photo library access** through iOS Settings > Deets > Photos at any time.

## Data Collection and Storage

### Phase 1 (Current Version): Local Storage Only

**Data Stored Locally on Your Device:**
- Contact information extracted from scanned images (names, phone numbers, email addresses, company names, addresses)
- Images of business cards or contact materials you capture
- Contact profiles you create or edit
- App preferences and settings

**Data NOT Collected:**
- We do not collect analytics or usage data
- We do not collect device identifiers
- We do not collect location data
- We do not collect crash reports or diagnostics
- We do not use cookies or tracking technologies

**Local Storage Security:**
- All data is stored using iOS secure storage mechanisms
- Data is protected by your device's passcode and biometric authentication
- Data is encrypted at rest using iOS system-level encryption
- Data is included in your encrypted iOS device backups

### Phase 2 (Future): Optional iCloud Sync

In future updates, we may offer **optional** iCloud synchronization:
- You will have explicit control to enable or disable iCloud sync
- If enabled, your contact data will sync across your Apple devices signed in with the same Apple ID
- iCloud data is encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple
- We do not have access to your iCloud data
- You can disable iCloud sync at any time through app settings

**iCloud sync will always be optional.** Local-only storage will remain the default.

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

**We do not share your data with third parties. Period.**

- No advertising networks
- No analytics providers
- No data brokers
- No social media platforms
- No marketing services
- No AI training or model development

**The only data sharing that occurs:**
- When YOU explicitly choose to share a contact via iOS system sharing features (Messages, Mail, AirDrop, etc.)
- Contact data YOU save to your iOS Contacts database (managed by Apple, subject to Apple's privacy policy)

## Your Privacy Rights

### Access and Control
You have complete control over your data:
- **Access:** View all data stored in the app at any time
- **Edit:** Modify any contact information or images

### Data Deletion
To delete your data from Deets:

**Delete Individual Contacts:**

2. Tap the delete button
3. Confirm deletion

**Delete All Data:**
1. Go to iOS Settings > General > iPhone Storage
2. Select Deets
3. Tap "Delete App"
4. This removes the app and all associated data permanently

**Note:** Contacts saved to your iOS Contacts app are managed separately and can be deleted through the Contacts app.

### Data Portability
Your data is stored in standard formats:
- Contact information follows vCard standards
- Images are stored in standard iOS photo formats
- You can export contacts using iOS system sharing at any time

## Children's Privacy
