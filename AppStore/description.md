Meet once. Remember always.

Deets is a privacy-first business card scanner for iOS. Scan cards, extract contact info, and save to your iPhone—all without sending data to the cloud.

PRIVACY BY DESIGN

• Everything happens on your device
No servers. No cloud processing. No tracking. Business card scanning uses Apple's VisionKit, which processes images entirely on your iPhone.

• No account required
Download, scan, done. We don't collect your email, phone number, or any personal information.

• Your data stays yours
Export to Apple Contacts, VCF, or CSV anytime. Delete the app and your data is completely removed.

• Optional iCloud sync
Turn on iCloud sync if you want contacts across devices. Still encrypted by Apple. Still private.

SIMPLE SCANNING

• Point and shoot
Hold your iPhone over a business card. Deets automatically detects text and extracts contact information.

• Smart parsing
Name, title, company, email, phone, website—all extracted and organized for you.

• Edit before saving
Review and correct any fields before saving. Perfect for handwritten cards or unusual formats.

CONTACT MANAGEMENT

• Save to Apple Contacts
Export contacts directly to your iPhone's Contacts app with one tap.

• Search and filter
Find contacts quickly with instant search. Filter by company, favorites, or recent additions.

• Mark favorites
Star important contacts for quick access.

• Add notes
Remember where you met, what you discussed, or follow-up reminders.

EXPORT OPTIONS

• VCF (vCard) files
Industry-standard format compatible with any contact manager.

• CSV spreadsheets
Export to Excel, Google Sheets, or your CRM.

• Batch export
Select multiple contacts and export them all at once.

• Share anywhere
Use iOS ShareSheet to send contacts via email, Messages, AirDrop, or any app.

OFFLINE FIRST

• No internet required
Scan, save, and manage contacts completely offline. Perfect for conferences, trade shows, or international travel.

• Works everywhere
Airplane mode, underground parking, remote locations—Deets works anywhere.

BUILT FOR iOS

• SwiftUI interface
Fast, native, and follows iOS design guidelines.

• Dynamic Type support
Text scales with your accessibility settings.

• VoiceOver compatible
Full screen reader support for visually impaired users.

• Dark mode
Automatically adapts to your system appearance.

WHAT DEETS DOESN'T DO

• No ads, ever
We don't show ads or collect data for advertising.

• No subscription
One-time purchase. No recurring fees. Own it forever.

• No social features
No profiles, no followers, no social network. Just your contacts.

• No analytics
We don't track how you use the app. Your behavior is private.

WHY DEETS?

After attending countless conferences, we were frustrated by business card apps that required cloud accounts, sent data to third-party servers, or had clunky interfaces. We built Deets to be the card scanner we wanted: fast, private, and offline-first.

TECHNICAL DETAILS

• Requires iOS 17.0 or later
Deets uses SwiftData and VisionKit, which require modern iOS.

• Camera required
Business card scanning needs a camera. Not supported in Simulator.

• On-device processing
All OCR (text recognition) happens on your device using Apple's VisionKit framework.
