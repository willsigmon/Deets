## WRITING GUIDELINES FOR "WHAT'S NEW"

### DO:
✅ Start with version number and brief summary
✅ Use bullet points (easier to scan)
✅ Group changes by category (New, Improved, Fixed)
✅ Explain WHY features matter (not just WHAT changed)
✅ Keep language conversational ("We've rebuilt..." not "The app has been rebuilt...")
✅ End with contact info or call-to-action
✅ Include brand tagline at end (initial release only)

### DON'T:
❌ Just list generic "Bug fixes and improvements"
❌ Use jargon or technical terms (e.g., "Refactored SwiftData layer")
❌ Make promises you can't keep ("Never crashes again!")
❌ Write in third person ("This update includes...")
❌ Over-hype minor changes ("Revolutionary new feature: bug fix!")
❌ Forget to thank users

### TONE:
- **Confident**: We know what we're doing
- **Human**: Talk to users, not at them
- **Clear**: No marketing speak, just facts
